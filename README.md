## Mobile Signal Strength

I got inspired to do this project when struggling with cell reception issues in my apartment. I basically did mobile network shopping by having service on two different phones from two different networks. I did research and found that signal strength is measured in decibels (dBm) and that it's a scale where an increment of 10 means a tenfold in power. 

I decided to model it using an exponential function and a fairly arbitrary dataset, with -130 corresponding to 10, -120 corresponding to 100, and so on. I then developed a Python web service that would return the strength value from this model given a signal in dBm, and a website where you can fill out a form and invoke this web service. 

### Folders

- api: the Python web service
- build: the static files generated by Create React App that are the ones actually used on the website's server
- public: the generic static files generated by Create React App (and only slightly modified by me)
- src: where the real front-end code lives. Everything outside index.css/.js was written by me
